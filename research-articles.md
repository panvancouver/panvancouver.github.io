BC:
* The EY report recommended closing schools and amalgamating student populations into new "right sized facilities".  These new "right sized" facilities must conform to the rigorous area standard restrictions -introduced by the Liberal government in 2008 - limiting the amount of square footage each student is entitled to. This is calculated on a nominal student capacity of only 25, whereas provincial class maximums are 30.  On average, since the new area standards came into effect, replacement schools are 65% of the original school size.

> The consequence of high-density conditions that involve either too many children or too little space are: excess levels of stimulation; stress and arousal; a drain on resource available; considerable interference; reductions in desired privacy levels; and loss of control.
