Yesterday (November 12, 2015) the Minister of Education released how his department awarded more than $35 million worth of improvement projects to schools throughout the province, as part of the [Province's Routine Capital Program](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2015EDUC0075-001895).

None of the funds went to Vancouver schools though VSB had requested $5 million.

​
 "Bernier’s ministry said in a statement that it decided to exclude Vancouver after launching the funding program in August. Its original announcement made no reference to that decision.

“In the process of weighing these special capital funding applications, the government focused on school projects with the greatest return on investment and on districts outside Vancouver, which normally receive much less capital funding than Vancouver,” the ministry said."
