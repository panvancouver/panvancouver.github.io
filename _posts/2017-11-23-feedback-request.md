PAN is supporting the great work of our partners at the BC Poverty Reduction Coalition (BCPRC). Please join us and speak up on the issue of raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. Now is the opportunity to **Tell the Fair Wages Commission it is Time for $15/hr in BC!**

Organizations and individuals are invited to provide feedback to the commission by email – use the BCFed’s tool to send a quick email: [http://www.fightfor15bc.ca/fairwages](http://www.fightfor15bc.ca/fairwages) by December 7, 2017.
