There will be a by-election in Vancouver on October 14th to elect nine Trustees to the Vancouver Board of Education for a one year term.
 
There are 19 individuals who’ve put their names forward as candidates. Some are running as independents, some with existing political parties. Some names are familiar, some are less known.
 
The Parent Advocacy Network (PAN) believes citizens of Vancouver, especially parents of school-aged children, should cast a vote in the by-election. We also believe voters should do their due diligence and get informed about all the candidates to make an informed choice; informed about both the candidates’ platforms and experience, but also important is who they are and how they plan to effect change.
 
**We are asking all 19 candidates these 6 questions** and we will post their answers – **Due by October 1, 2017** – (or their lack of response) on our website by October 4th to help voters make an informed choice.
 
**Questions for Trustee Candidates**

1. What skills would you bring to a trustee position and why should Vancouverites vote for you as an individual (leaving aside party affiliation)?
2. If elected, how will you promote an atmosphere of collaboration with advisor Dianne Turner, senior staff, and Board members from other political parties?
3. As an elected trustee, how would you envision the role of parent input with respect to decision making?
4. Explain your perspective on how the Board should work going forward with the provincial Ministry of Education.
5. What is your view on how the Board should work going forward with the City of Vancouver (i.e. in addressing the intertwined issues of densification and available school space)?
6. What do you see as the top three most urgent and important issues facing the Vancouver School Board, and how do you plan to address these?
