[Over 200 schools](http://bctf.ca/data.cfm?page=SchoolClosures) have been closed in British Columbia over the last fifteen years. Up to 20 more will be announced in Vancouver alone on Monday. Though sometimes it does make sense for a district to close a school, other times closures are forced upon a district by chronic provincial underfunding and an Education Ministry's refusal to provide predictable, stable resources for districts.
 
Schools are far more than just buildings. They're central to every community they occupy. To treat them as mere vessels of statistics and arbitrary utilization rates is an insult to all the children, teachers, administrators, staff, parents, and community residents whose lives are touched by them.
 
**Join us 6:40pm Monday June 20th outside the VSB School Board (10th & Fir)** to mourn the loss of all the schools that have been shuttered across our province, and to stand by the Vancouver School Board Trustees who have been fiercely advocating to keep our district's public education system healthy and thriving.
