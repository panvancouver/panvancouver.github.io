The Parent Advocacy Network steering committee is pleased and proud to hear the news that one of our co-founders, Andrea Sinclair, has been elected Second Vice-President of the BC Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils.

We know that Andrea will be a stellar representative for parents and children in public education at the provincial level. BCCPAC’s voice is needed more than ever in this time of confusion over the class size and composition agreement, in addition to the ongoing need for adequate funding and urgently required seismic fixes. Andrea’s knowledge of the issues, her dedication to public education, and her good humour will be assets to BCCPAC.

​We congratulate Andrea and all the new BCCPAC executives, and thank them for stepping up to ensure the best possible public education for all of BC’s children.
