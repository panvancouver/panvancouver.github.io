lead: "​As you probably have heard, the Ministry of Education decided to return the $25 million in additional 'administrative savings' in its 2016 budget to the school districts to spend as they please.

​As you probably have heard, the Ministry of Education decided to return the $25 million in additional 'administrative savings' in its 2016 budget to the school districts to spend as they please. For Vancouver, this means $2.25 million will go back into its 2016/17 budget reducing the shortfalls from $24.05 million to $21.8 million.

As you are probably also aware, the previous budget did not pass on April 28th. Trustees Joy Alexander, Patti Bacchus, Janet Fraser, Mike Lombardi and Alan Wong voted no ... just like we asked them too, the cuts were too severe and would negatively impact all children, especially the more vulnerable. The cuts are still being implemented by the superintendent as he is required to do. He is now implementing the newly revised budget proposal.

TONIGHT, there is going to be a Committee of the Whole/Special Board Meeting starting at 5pm. This is another opportunity to tell the trustees what we want them to do, and to show the government that we're paying attention and believe education is a top priority.

Will this release of funds by the government be enough to make our 'noise' go away or are there still too many cuts to our children's classroom and support systems? If this revised budget, with $21.8 million in cuts,  was presented on March 31 would we still would have said NO, enough is enough and this is too much? Find out tonight. **PAN is planning to speak. Join us. Wear your RED. Bring your #BCEdInRed signs. Sign up to speak** (sign up is on-site (VSB board office) starting at 4:30pm).

**NOTE**: At ANY board meeting this June, including the one tonight after the presentations, a trustee who voted NO on April 28th can put forth a motion to reconsider that vote. This means the trustees could again vote to amend, pass, or not pass, this revised 'balanced' budget (or a future one if the situation again changes) before June 30th.
