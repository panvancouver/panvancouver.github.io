[VSB2021 Strategic Plan and Public Consultations](http://www.vsb.bc.ca/vsb2021)

As you are aware, the VSB is seeking feedback from parents, staff and students on the creation of a new Strategic Plan (this is different to the Long Range Facilities Plan and the input being sought for that). 

Whether you love 'em or hate 'em, its important we as parents provide input and have our voices heard! The strategic plan will have real implications for funding decisions around programming, staffing and resource distribution across the district.  

This is a great opportunity for parents/guardians, teachers, stakeholders  - everyone - to give their feedback! We need to capitalize on this chance and encourage everyone in our networks to fill in the survey, candidly and thoughtfully.

**What is the Strategic Plan?**  
The Strategic Plan is a blueprint that sets the educational priorities of the Board for the next five years. To review the last Strategic Plan (2011-2016) go to [http://www.vsb.bc.ca/sites/default/files/publication-files/VSB_StrategicPlanandgoalsJan302012.pdf](http://www.vsb.bc.ca/sites/default/files/publication-files/VSB_StrategicPlanandgoalsJan302012.pdf)

The Strategic Plan is based on the following questions:
* How can we make sure that all students have equal access to quality education?
* How can we engage our students to reach their full potential?
* What role should our schools play in their communities?
* How do we set priorities and use resources most efficiently?


**How should I get involved?**

1. Fill in the survey - [http://fluidsurveys.com/s/VSB2021/](http://fluidsurveys.com/s/VSB2021/) - Deadline is Feb 21

The VSB has released a [3 question survey](http://fluidsurveys.com/s/VSB2021) for parents/guardians to complete and allows for open comments - [http://fluidsurveys.com/s/VSB2021/](http://fluidsurveys.com/s/VSB2021/)

The deadline for the online survey is Feb 21 and it is important that as many parents as possible participate.

The strategic plan will have real implications for funding decisions around programming, staffing and resource distribution across the district.  


2. Attend the Ideas Fair on Thurs Feb 18 at Prince of Wales Secondary, from 4-7pm  
This will be an open public forum, drop-in style.


3. Attend the Open House on Thur Apr 21 at Sir Charles Tupper Secondary, from 4-7pm  
This will be an open public forum, drop-in style.


**Issues to consider that relate to our PAN mandate for high quality, accessible and equitable public education for all children are noted below - these may assist you in answering the survey.**

* Choice schools are not accessible to all and can undermine diversity in neighbourhood schools. Neighbourhood schools are the key to community strength. The Board should prioritize and advocate for their preservation. Surplus capacity should be addressed through rightsizing and/or partially repurposing spaces.

* All schools should provide ongoing supported curricular elementary education in Visual Arts, Music and drama, and have access to a library staffed by a teacher librarian.

* Resources (learning materials, musical instruments, sports and science equipment)  must be equal across schools, not dependent on the fundraising ability of individual PACs and communities.

* Expand food programs to children at risk and continue to advocate with the ministry for more poverty reduction funding.

* Children with special needs should be provided with intervention programs, workers and teachers trained to build the specific skills and independence they require to succeed and integrate.  

* The new curriculumâ€™s emphasis on personalized and hands on learning, collaboration, creative problem solving and technology must be supported with funding for sufficient training, staffing, and appropriate spatial requirements necessary for its implementation.

* The advancement of technology in schools must be balanced by careful consideration of child health, child privacy and the cost of equipment/infrastructure.  It should not come at the expense of relational building between teachers and between students.

* All schools and not just new schools with Neighbourhood Learning Centres should have adequate space for arts, recreation and services that would serve the unique needs of each community
