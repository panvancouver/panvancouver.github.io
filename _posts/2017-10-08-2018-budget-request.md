On Friday, October 6th, we made our third annual presentation to the Legislative Finance Committee ([Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services](https://www.leg.bc.ca/parliamentary-business/committees/41stparliament-2ndsession-fgs)) highlighting public education funding needs for BC Budget 2018.

In it, we called on government to fulfill its commitment to British Columbians: 

1. To affordability – through a fully funded quality public education system that is accessible to all children, not just those whose families can afford to subsidize it.
2. To dependability – so that every child can attend a fully resourced neighbourhood school no matter where they live.
3. To a broad-based economy – by providing a public education that has the breadth and quality needed to support a strong, innovative economy so all children have equal opportunity to reach their individual potential.
4. To funding the human resources necessary to support the delivery and integration of first nations curriculum and culture into schools.
