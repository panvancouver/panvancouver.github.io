**Thank you** to all who have supported our activities and efforts recently with our postcard campaign and online petition. We currently have over 1600 signatures with more still coming in! 

Keep sharing the cards and the [petition]!

**Big** thanks to all who helped make our media event at the Premier's office yesterday a huge success. We believe the more awareness we can generate and the more information we can help circulate, the more people will ask questions and demand answers!

Both PAN and FACE received great media coverage over the last few days in major outlets - TV, radio and print/online. [Check out our website for links and information](https://panvancouver.github.io/).

**Representation and Members**  
We now have PAN representation at 49 schools across Vancouver! This is increasing steadily and with broader school representation, the stronger our voice to the VSB and other stakeholders.

Attached is our PAN Backgrounder document which can be shared with PACs and parents, posted to bulletin boards etc. 
 
**Next Meeting**  
Our next PAN meeting is scheduled for next week on **Monday February 1, 7:00-9:00pm**, at the Tipper (2066 Kingsway, back room) We invite you to join us and other like-minded parents and contribute your ideas and action.
