PAN was pleased to be included in [Richmond Schools Stand United](http://www.richmondschoolsunited.ca/) (RSSU)'s rally on Saturday, September 17, 2016. Great turnout of concerned kids, families and concerned community members protesting school closures (on Friday, 3 vibrant schools in Richmond were named as likely to close in June 2017) and underfunding of public education. Our Andrea Sinclair [spoke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfwmiuEYjFo&feature=youtu.be) on the importance of advocacy while Jen Stewart of Families Against Cuts to Education (FACE) and PAN wrapped up the rally with a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_v90luwwVs&feature=youtu.be) on provincial underfunding.
