George Heyman, MLA asked us two questions after our presentation to the Select Standing Committee on Finance and Government Services on Monday, September 19, 2016. We would really appreciate your help answering them.

1. â€‹One of them is.... You talked about parents fundraising. I've certainly heard a lot of that when I attend parent advisory committees in my constituency. So I'm wondering if you could provide a list of the kinds of things over the last decade that parents have been asked to fundraise for which were previously considered, or which you consider to be, part of the basic education system that should be provided.
2. The other one is.... Under the capacity utilization, you mentioned early childhood education. I know there are some other uses to which school space is put which are not factored by the Ministry of Education. Putting that on the record as well and their use in the community would be very helpful.

Over the last decade have parents at your school been asked to fundraise for items which were previously considered, or which you consider to be, part of the basic education system that should be provided?

What educational services have you (as a parent) paid for which were previously considered, or which you consider should be, part of the basic educational system. Please list services and costs?

Are there classrooms at your school that are used for purposes other than homeroom teacher instruction (such as robotics lab, daycare space, music room, parent room, family resource program, or ELL class)?
