On April 1, 2016, the Parent Advocacy Network for Public Education (PAN) sent its “[PAN Questions on BC Budget 2016: Ministry of Education](/downloads/pan_questions_on_bc_budget_2016_moe_final.pdf)” document to the BC Ministry of Education, Ministry of Finance, the provincial political parties, and the media.

On April 26, 2016 we posted [some answers](/2016/04/26/answers-to-pans-questions) we had gathered to date through dialogue with the Ministry of Education and further research. 

On June 3, 2016 we got another response from the Ministry of Education which included [these answers to our questions](/downloads/186903_answers_to_pan_questions_2016.pdf) (this is the document we received) plus the template of what they were looking for for '[Administrative Savings Plan](/downloads/sample_-_administrative_savings_plan.pdf).'

While we don't feel that all our questions were answered to our satisfaction, we appreciate their response and apologize for the tardiness of us getting this posted.
