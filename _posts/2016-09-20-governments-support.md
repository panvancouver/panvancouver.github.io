While we have not been feeling the love from the provincial government — the Minister of Education continues to refuse to meet with us — this week we have felt the love from other levels of government.

On Monday, September 19, 2016, MP Don Davies (Vancouver-Kingsway), called on the Prime Minister to make federal funds available to seismically upgrade BC schools.

On Tuesday, September 20, 2016 City of Vancouver Councillor Andrea Reimer brought the motion "[Standing Up for Vancouver's Neighbourhood Schools](http://council.vancouver.ca/20160920/documents/motionb3.pdf)" to City Council. The motion requires a letter be written to the Ministry of Education requesting that the Provincial capacity-utilization requirements be amended to:
* allow for a lower capacity requirement where mitigating factors exist, such as significant enrolment fluctuation;
* decouple the requirement for school boards to close schools in order to get funding for life-saving seismic upgrades;
* support right-sizing of neighbourhood schools where there is a clear, consistent trend of lower enrolment; and
* change the formula for calculating capacity to reflect that place-based learning is critical for the success of inner city and Aboriginal learners.

It passed unanimously.
