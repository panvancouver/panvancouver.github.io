WHAT'S HAPPENING TO PUBLIC EDUCATION in BC?

Government policies and funding decisions are dismantling the democratic foundations of public education, undermining social equality and increasing pressures to compensate through fundraising and corporate sponsorship. Most recently, the ministry of education is pressuring the VSB to achieve 95 percent capacity in order to secure seismic funding.  What does this mean for the future of public education in BC?  What can we do to help return public education back to its core communal values?

Come with your questions and concerns and join us for a panel presentation and discussion with the Public **Education Network Society** (PENS) and the **Parent Advocacy Network for Public Education** (PAN). Find out how you can make a difference in simple but effective ways.

**PENS** is an influential advocacy movement that launched the Charter for Public Education and has united stakeholders from across the educational landscape in advocating for public education for over a decade. 

**PAN** is a grassroots collective of parents from across Vancouver schools who share a commitment to public education. Their mission is to connect parents and PACs across the district to support one another in advocacy.

**Our Panelists**:  
**William Bruneau** is Professor Emeritus at UBC who writes widely on musical, cultural and political matters. Was an elected VSB Trustee between 1990-1993.
“​What's Really Essential in BC Public Education? Coming to Terms with Curriculum, Teaching, and Governance.”

**John Malcolmson** has been a researcher for CUPE for over 30 years, with a focus on public education and finance, justice issues and social policy analysis. 
"Changes in Government Funding Policies: How they undermined both Quality and Equality"
