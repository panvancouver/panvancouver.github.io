**Important Advocacy Moment**

**Monday April 25 at 7:00pm** is the final VSB public consultation session before Trustees vote on the proposed budget for the coming school year.

This proposed VSB Budget reflects 10+ years of administrative and other cuts and NOW more than ever before, *this budget will be materially damaging to education in Vancouver and the equity within our system. These $24M in cuts will be detrimental to ALL our children in their classrooms and will be felt for years to come.*

**Parent Advocacy Network members believe this budget is unsupportable and it's time to TAKE A STAND!**

**Once again PAN will be presenting at 7pm (we are #2 on the Agenda) - and this time we are asking Trustees to unite and REJECT the Budget and DEMAND the Government provide adequate and stable funding for public education as is their legal obligation.**

We invite all parents/guardians, grandparents, aunts and uncles and families to STAND with us and WEAR RED as a visible indication of protest - [BC Budget is in the Black and BC Ed is in the RED](/bcedinred) - and support the [#BCEDINRED campaign](/bcedinred)


This is our best opportunity to make a visible statement and protest the continued government underfunding.

We NEED your support - Please make an effort to Join us and TAKE A STAND!

When its our turn to present, we ask all those in attendance to STAND UP in their RED!


WHO: Parent Advocacy Network members and all parents/PACs in Vancouver


WHAT: Wear RED and STAND with us


WHEN: 7:00-7:30pm, Mon Apr 25
