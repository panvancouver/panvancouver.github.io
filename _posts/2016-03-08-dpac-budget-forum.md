As an official stakeholder with the VSB, the Vancouver District Parent Council (DPAC) is holding a **"Budget Forum" this week Thursday March 10 at 7pm**.


They have invited VSB staff and Trustees to attend their meeting to review the VSB 2015/1016 operating budget - there is an anticipated a $1.23M surplus at the end of this financial year (June 30), as well as the 2016/17 budget shortfall, estimated at $24.38M. 
Parents will have the unique opportunity to hear directly from VSB senior staff (Russell Horswill, Secretary Treasurer; Lisa Landry, Director of Finance; and Scott Robinson, Superintendent) and ask them questions to better understand the VSB financial situation, the budget procedures and timeline.    
Staff will not be sharing the Budget proposals this week - these will be presented at a Committee III/V meeting on March 31 which parents can also attend but its not an open forum for questions.  For the full budget timeline see [http://www.vsb.bc.ca/20162017-budget](http://www.vsb.bc.ca/20162017-budget)

DPAC Budget Forum meeting will be in Room #120 at the VSB offices (main floor, 1580 West Broadway at Fir, parking free if you put license plate # on list upstairs). 

The DPAC meeting runs 7-9pm but its our understanding that the Budget discussion will be first up at 7pm and go for about 30 minutes.

*All parents are welcome at DPAC meetings* - you do not have to be on your school PAC to attend - anyone can attend.

We encourage you to share this with your parent community and **encourage you to attend this meeting on Thursday** - its a great opportunity to hear directly from VSB regarding their Budget and ask your questions directly of staff and Trustees.
