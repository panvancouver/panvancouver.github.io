This morning the Parent Advocacy Network (PAN) sent the Minister and Deputy Minister of Education a researched letter of petition signed by 73 parent and community advocacy groups, university art educators and art professionals calling attention to the dramatic decline in access to K-12 arts education across BC and underscoring its vital importance for students in both academic development and social emotional wellbeing.  We hope that our collective voice will communicate the urgency of this issue and create the will and context for purposeful action.

The Honourable Rob Fleming, Minister of Education
Scott MacDonald, Deputy Minister

Dear Sirs,

We, as citizens, parents, educators and arts professionals are writing to express our collective concern regarding the marginalization of the arts (visual and performing) within K-12 public education and ask that the government commit to restore arts education within our public schools. 

**Executive Summary**

The arts are relevant and vital to a public education system that seeks to allow all learners to “be literate, to develop their individual potential and to acquire the knowledge, skills, and attitudes needed to contribute to a healthy, democratic, and pluralistic society and a prosperous and sustainable economy.”[\[i\]](#i) Education in the arts has a significant role to play in developing the social and emotional wellbeing of students and in equipping them with the creative, critical and empathic capacities needed to meet the social and economic challenges of a rapidly changing and interconnected world. 

The absence of protected, targeted funding for the arts, coupled with the pressure to reduce operational expenditures at the school district level, has led to a steady and persistent erosion of quality and access to arts education over the last two decades. This erosion encompasses significant and critical losses in specialist expertise, material resources and dedicated space across K-12. In 2015/16, less than half of grade 4 and 7 students across the province indicated that they were learning about art or music.[\[ii\]](#ii) Dedicated spaces for art and music continue to be systematically eliminated as schools are rebuilt or seismically retrofitted to conform to the [Ministry Area Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/administration/resource-management/capital-planning/areastandards.pdf) that restrict the allowable square footage for new school facilities. 

The public education system no longer provides a comprehensive, consistent or quality arts education. As a result, arts instruction is being outsourced through private lessons, charities or PAC fundraising, creating unacceptable inequity of access to the arts based on socio-economic advantage. A growing body of research underscores the pivotal role of art education for vulnerable student populations in academic success, mental health and social engagement. Participation in the cultural life of the community and the enjoyment of the arts is a fundamental human right; it is also integral to the implementation of the redesigned BC curriculum.

Urgent intervention is needed to restore equitable access to a quality arts education as a core element within the K-12 curriculum. We ask that the government:
* Amend the [Ministry Area Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/administration/resource-management/capital-planning/areastandards.pdf) to ensure that all new schools have sufficient dedicated space to provide quality arts education for future generations
* Allocate additional, targeted and protected funding to all school districts to enable them to provide the expertise and material resources needed to support a quality arts education for all students

**Context and Background**

Arts Education is ImportantEducation in the arts is essential for both the socio-emotional and the academic development of children.  The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), supported by a growing body of research, identifies the importance of quality arts education for renewing educational systems that seek to prepare students for the social, cultural and economic challenges of today’s rapidly changing world.[\[iii\]](#iii) 

The core competencies in the redesigned BC curriculum (critical and creative thinking, communication, understanding of personal and cultural identities and social responsibility) all underscore the relevance of the arts, as these are the skills and habits of mind that the arts intrinsically teach.[\[iv\]](#iv)

**Education in the arts is needed to develop:**

*Innovation and Creativity*

Artistic practices intrinsically develop the divergent thinking, flexible purposing, persistence and critical reflection central to the creative process. Education in the arts is therefore key for developing the innovative capacities identified by educational and business leaders as the primary skill set for competitiveness in our 21st century economy[\[v\]](#v). Canada falls well below the OECD average for percentage of time allocated to compulsory arts education.[\[vi\]](#vi) While Canada performs high on current international PISA tests, the World Economic Forum shows its economic competitiveness to be compromised by relatively weak innovation capacity.[\[vii\]](#vii)

*Visual Literacy*

Digital media has transformed the means by which we share and transmit information. Today, over 85% of the information we absorb daily is visual.[\[viii\]](#viii)  Education in the arts has a role and a responsibility to equip students with the visual literacy and cultural understanding needed to critically engage and meaningfully contribute within our increasingly mediated public sphere.[\[ix\](#ix)

*Mental Health and Societal Well-being*

Research in education and science link engagement in the arts to building the self-confidence, self-regulation and resilience needed for social and emotional well-being.[x] Anxiety, depression and substance misuse are increasing amongst our youth and the arts are shown to promote mental wellbeing through hands on, material exploration and nurturing a healthy sense of identity through authentic self-expression. The latest research in neuroscience links arts to developing empathy and attending to the perspective of others.[\[xi\]](#xi) This has broad implications for societal health and fostering intercultural understanding.[\[xii\]](#xii) 

*Personal Fulfillment and Inclusion*

The arts are essential for cultivating imaginative thought, the senses and the capacity for play. These are key capabilities internationally recognized as indicators of the degree of human well-being, freedom and justice in a society.[\[xiii\]](#xiii) Further to this, participation in cultural production and enjoyment of the arts is not only identified by the United Nations as a fundamental human right[\[xiv\]](#xiv), it is integral to Indigenous ways of knowing, learning and cultural empowerment.[\[xv\]](#xv) A commitment to the educational goals of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission must include access to culturally appropriate education in the arts for all students.[\[xvi\]](#xvi)

**Arts Education in BC Has Been Eroded**

The lack of protected, targeted funding for the arts within the education funding envelope, coupled with the pressure to reduce operational expenditures at the school district level, has led to a steady and persistent erosion of quality and access to arts education across K-12 public education over the last two decades. This erosion encompasses significant loss in expertise, material resources and dedicated space. 

In elementary schools, when imaginative capacities are most crucially formed, there has been a precipitous decline in specialist teachers.[\[xvii\]](#xvii) Universities and other teacher-accreditation bodies have similarly reduced or eliminated arts education specialist training, particularly at the elementary level. The responsibility for arts education is now placed on generalist teachers, the majority of whom have limited background or training in the arts.[\[xviii\]](#xviii) According to the 2015/16, less than half of grade 4 and 7 students across the province indicated that they were learning about art or music.[\[xix\]](#xix) Loss of quality, knowledge-based arts education at the elementary level has had a cumulative impact on the decline in quality and scope of fine and applied arts programming at the secondary level, where arts teachers are already under strain to generalize instruction and maximize class sizes for cost efficiencies.[\[xx\]](#xx) Even where specialists are retained, the amount of compulsory time allocated to the arts has been dramatically reduced; in elementary, arts specialists are now prep time teachers and in secondary, the number of required fine and applied art graduation credits have been reduced by 75%.[\[xxi\]](#xxi) Once the new 2018 graduation guidelines take effect, students will no longer need a single fine or applied arts course to graduate. This decline in specialized time and instruction has resulted in a corresponding loss of art and music rooms.

Schools across the province are being rebuilt and seismically retrofitted to conform to Ministry Area Standards introduced in 2004 that restrict the allowable square footage for new school facilities.[\[xxii\]](#xxii) This document does not allow space provisions for art, music or performance space within elementary schools. The cost of including this additional square footage would increase the cost of construction by only 2%.[\[xxiii\]](#xxiii) Dedicated space that can accommodate the materials, equipment and spatial arrangements for engagement in the arts is essential to quality programming. Without intervention, arts education will be structurally and systematically eliminated within the public school system for the next generation and beyond.

Inequities Result from the Erosion of Arts EducationIn the absence of comprehensive, consistent and equitable arts education within public schools, families are outsourcing access to the arts through private lessons and PAC fundraising.[\[xxiv\]](#xxiv) This creates inequity of access to arts education based on socio economic status.  Given that aboriginal and immigrant families are disproportionately represented within disadvantaged populations[\[xxv\]](#xxv), and that the arts are shown (through longitudinal studies) to correlate with improved life outcomes for at-risk youth[\[xxvi\]](#xxvi) in academic achievement, employment opportunities and civic engagement, the loss of arts programming in schools should be a matter of grave concern.

The evacuation of arts programming at all levels within our public education system has reached a critical juncture. A quality arts education is essential for the economic prosperity and health of our society. Although the BC government, underscored by the evidence of arts organizations across BC,[\[xxvii\]](#xxvii) acknowledges the fundamental importance of the arts for both economic and societal wellbeing, this understanding is not being supported at its most foundational level: our K-12 public education system.[\[xxviii\]](#xxviii) Investment in the creative economy begins by giving every child the opportunity to develop their creative and aesthetic potential within a quality, publicly funded education system. If we acknowledge that the arts are fundamental to human flourishing, and that public education should empower students to be creative and compassionate contributors to the building of a healthy, pluralistic and democratic society, we must ensure that quality arts education is financially supported and protected across K-12 public education.

Therefore, to fulfill its responsibility and provide equitable access to a quality arts education as a key element within the K-12 curriculum, we the undersigned, request that the government work to:
* Amend the [Ministry Area Standards](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/administration/resource-management/capital-planning/areastandards.pdf) to ensure that all new school builds have sufficient dedicated space to provide quality arts education for future generations
* Allocate additional, targeted and protected funding to all school districts to enable them to  provide the expertise and material resources needed to support a quality arts education for all students
