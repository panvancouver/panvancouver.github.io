PAN has presented to the Select Standing Committee on Finance & Government Services two years running. In preparation for our 2017 presentation to the Committee and to help us better understand exactly where the issues are with insufficient funding and/or the unintended effects of the implementation of the Supreme Court of Canada ruling regarding class size and composition, we are asking for your input from the front lines. 
 
As parents, you know and see where the deficiencies are, where things are not as they should be. Our brief survey is below - we would really appreciate your help in gathering this data.


1. Do you feel you have a good understanding about the changes being made in your child's school (and classroom) as a result of the Supreme Court of Canada ruling and changes in maximum class size and composition?
2. For this school year, has your school lost (or is going to lose) any non-enrolling space to be used as classrooms? (eg: resource or sensory rooms; art, music or computer rooms; library, gym or lunchroom space, etc.)
3. For this school year, has your school gained any non-enrolling space? (eg: resource or sensory rooms; art, music or computer rooms; library, gym or lunchroom space, etc.)
4. For this school year, does every division/class at your childâ€™s school have a permanent full-time teacher (not substitute or TOC) assigned to it? 
5. For this school year, do all divisions/classes in your school have their own classroom?
6. For this school year, do you feel your school is prepared to provide the services and resources needed to support your special needs student community?
