The Parent Advocacy Network (PAN) has reviewed the platforms of the three main political parties - BC Green Party, BC Liberal Party, BC NDP Party. We have examined the multi-page documents against the public education issues raised in our Declaration in Defence of Public Education released back in February. We wanted to know how each party plans to address these demands - or not - and to better understand their stated commitments (future actions, not past) going forward for public education in BC.
â€‹We've highlighted their verbatim position vis a vis our Demands in this quick and easy to read document.

1. Get informed.
2. Ask questions.
3. Get out and vote on May 9th.
