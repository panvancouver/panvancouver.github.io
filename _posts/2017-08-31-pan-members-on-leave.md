The Parent Advocacy Network steering committee is excited to see two of its long-standing members - Carrie Bercic and Erica Jaaf - take a leave of absence from PAN to run in the upcoming school trustee by-election under OneCity. Both Erica and Carrie are strong, committed public education advocates; their knowledge of the issues and the needs of children in Vancouver will be an asset to parents across the district. We thank them for stepping forward to help make a difference and to increasing political diversity within the VSB Board.
