On May 10, 2016, PAN sent a [statement signed by 735 community members]() to the Minister of Education regarding the Vancouver School Board's budget situation.

On July 25, 2016 PAN received the [response from the Minister](/downloads/188180_pan_outgoing.pdf).

While we appreciate the correspondence, it contains many familiar government talking points that have been analyzed and refuted by, among others, the BC Office of the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives ([Education Crisis](http://www.policynote.ca/education-crisis/)) and Families Against Cuts to Education ([Seeing Through Spin](https://facebc.wordpress.com/2016/05/16/seeing-through-spin/) and [Underfunding is a Fact](https://facebc.wordpress.com/2016/06/29/underfunding-is-a-fact/)).
