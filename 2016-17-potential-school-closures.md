# 2016-17 VSB potential school closures

**On Monday, October 3, 2016 the Vancouver School Board trustees voted to suspend the school closure procedure and rescind the motions moving the 11 schools to consultation.**

This page is now for reference. The upcoming meeting dates are no longer relevant.
On June 20, 2016, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) released its preliminary list of 12 schools to be considered for possible closure as early as June 2017. Chronic underfunding from the provincial government has led the VSB to recommend the simultaneous closure of 12 Vancouver schools.  If all 12 schools close, 3,188 children will lose their neighbourhood school, thousands more will feel the impact in crowded facilities stripped of essential educational spaces, and vital community support networks will be dismantled. We believe this decision is not in the best interests of children, communities, or even taxpayers.  For parents whose children and neighbourhoods will be directly affected, this list is devastating and raises significant uncertainties for the coming school year and beyond.
 
We are sharing our research and findings related to the school closure situation to help inform and support the advocacy of parents and community members.

* On June 20, 2016, the Vancouver School Board (VSB) released its preliminary list of 12 schools to be considered for possible closure as early as June 2017.

* On September 29, 2016 we wrote to the VSB [Requesting Clarification and Action on School Closures Public Consultation Process](/2016/09/29/letter-to-the-vsb).
